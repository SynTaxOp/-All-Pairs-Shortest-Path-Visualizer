# APS-Project
The project is made in the form of an Android App, where there are activities made for entering the required data, marking the nodes and displaying the shortest path. 
It makes use of RecyclerView, Linear Layout, ScrollView and basic buttons for its operations. The algorithms are used once the data is entered and 'Calculate' button is pressed.
Instructions
(For best experience do not use in dark mode.)
The app opens and asks for the number of nodes, whether the graph is directed or undirected and the algorithm required by the user. Once all this information is enetered we move on to the activity where the nodes are marked and further distance between two nodes is entered. 
Mark a node by clicking on the box.
Once all the nodes are marked, click one node and click another to enter distance between the two. If invalid distance is entered, repeat the process. 
The distance you have entered will be shown below.
Once all distances are entered click 'Calculate' and then the shortest path between all pairs will be shown. 
Click on any item where the shortest distance is displayed to show the path followed for gaining the shortest distance.
Now click 'Restart' to enter fresh inputs.
